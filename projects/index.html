        <h3>oBot | <a href="https://github.com/owencompher/oBot" target="_blank">repository</a></h3><br>
        oBot is a simple discord bot that I made for use by myself and friends. It has a few simple
        call-and-response commands, as well as a configuration system and a useful text-to-speech function.<br>
