        <b>oBot | <a href="https://github.com/owencompher/oBot" target="_blank">repository</a></b>
            <p class="content">oBot is a simple discord bot that I made for use by myself and friends. It has a few simple
            call-and-response commands, as well as a configuration system and a useful text-to-speech function.

        <b>Pixel Art | <a href="https://o2c.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">gallery</a></b>
            <p class="content">Occasionally I make pixel art, which is a type of digital medium that is reminiscent of the low-quality
            textures of early video games. Most of what I make, however, just looks cool and is not supposed to
            be part of a game.

        <b>Drum Kit Sim | <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=44055" target="_blank">PIC0-8 forum</a></b>
            <p class="content">A small project I made in the PICO-8 game console. Controls are Z and X for the cymbals and
            the arrow keys for the drums.
