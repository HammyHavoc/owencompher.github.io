  <p>Instructions for downloading the mods for use on oServer:<br>
      Download the latest Forge version from <a href="https://minecraftforge.net" target="_blank">minecraftforge.net</a><br>
    Run the .jar and choose install to create the Forge profile in your launcher.<br>
      Download <a href="about:blank" target="_blank">this</a> .zip archive and extract all of the .jar mods into your .minecraft/mods folder.<br>
    Start the Forge profile in the launcher and verify that all three mods are loaded.<br>
    You should now be able to use proximity voice on the server. Usually 'v' is the keybind to open the voice chat settings.</p><br>
