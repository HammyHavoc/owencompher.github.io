  <p>Instructions for downloading the mods for use on oServer:
      Download the latest Forge version from <a href="https://minecraftforge.net" target="_blank">minecraftforge.net</a>
    Run the .jar and choose install to create the Forge profile in your launcher.
      Download <a href="about:blank" target="_blank">this</a> .zip archive and extract all of the .jar mods into your .minecraft/mods folder.
    Start the Forge profile in the launcher and verify that all three mods are loaded.
    You should now be able to use proximity voice on the server. Usually 'v' is the keybind to open the voice chat settings.</p>
